# JavaRepo

This program takes in the name of a file, analyses it, 
and displays the results to the user of whether the file was written in 
Formal or Informal Language.

There are 4 classes used. One to diplay the GUI screen, one with the screen 
and program functionality, one that compares each word of the document
with a file containing common slang words and finally a class containing file
managing methods.
